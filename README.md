# Weeby-JS
Weeby-JS is the official JavaScript API Wrapper which is powerful and allows easy interaction with the [Weeby API](https://weebyapi.xyz/) endpoints. Actively maintained by [NTM Development](https://dev.ntmcentral.xyz/) and community members, Weeby-JS receives new updates shortly after new features have been released to the API.

## Features
- Super simple and easy to use
- Built in documentation
- Includes all methods from Weeby API
- Object-Oriented
- Beginner friendly
- Support for TypeScript

## Installation
```bash
npm install weeby-js --save
```

## Authentication
`weeby-js` requires an authorization token which can be obtained by doing one of the following methods: 
- Joining the [NTM Central Discord Server](https://weebyapi.xyz/discord), and then running the `/apply` command with the Weeby API bot. 
- Logging into the [Dashboard](https://weebyapi.xyz/dashboard) and then using the [application form](https://weebyapi.xyz/dashboard/apply) and filling in the required fields.

To learn more in deep about the application process, please visit the [Getting Started](https://weebyapi.xyz/gettingstarted) page. 

> Upon being accepted into Weeby API. It is very important to **never** show this token to anybody.

## Example Usage

```js
const WeebyAPI = require('weeby-js');
const weeby = new WeebyAPI('YOUR_TOKEN');

const image = await weeby.generators.oneImage({ type: '3000years', image: 'https://i.imgur.com/qgKvcQv.png' });
channel.send({files: [{ attachment: image }]}); // -> Image Buffer
```
